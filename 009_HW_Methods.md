### **Homework Assignment: Slicing & Data Container Methods**

---

**Objective:** Understand and apply slicing techniques to strings, lists, and tuples. Familiarize yourself with the main methods of strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

---

#### **Part A: Slicing**

1. **Strings:**
    - Given the string `s = "ProgrammingIsFun"`, extract and print the substring "Program".
    - Extract and print the substring "Fun".
    - Extract and print every 3rd character of the string.
    
2. **Lists:**
    - Given the list `lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]`:
        - Extract and print the first 3 elements.
        - Extract and print the last 2 elements.
        - Extract and print the elements from index 3 to 6 (inclusive).
        - Extract and print every 2nd element from the list.
        - Extract and print every 2nd element *starting from the end of the list*.
        
3. **Tuples:**
    - Given the tuple `tup = (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40)`:
        - Extract and print the second element.
        - Extract and print the last 3 elements.
        - Extract and print the elements from index 2 to 5 (exclusive).

#### **Part B: Methods of Data Structures**

1. **Strings:**
    - Find and print the index of the first occurrence of the substring "ming" in `s`.
    - Convert the string `s` to lowercase and print the result.
    - Replace the substring "Fun" in `s` with "Amazing" and print the result.
    
2. **Lists:**
    - Add the elements `90` and `100` to the end of `lst` and print the updated list.
    - Remove the second element from `lst` and print the updated list.
    - Reverse the order of elements in `lst` and print the updated list.
    - Find and print the index of element `50` in `lst`.
    
3. **Tuples:**
    - Count and print the number of occurrences of `20` in `tup`.
    - Convert `tup` into a list, add the number `45` at its end, then convert it back to a tuple. Print the new tuple.
    
4. **Dictionaries:**
    - Given the dictionary `S_Doo_ = {"Scooby": 4, "Shaggy": 19, "Velma": 18, "Daphne": 20}`
        - Add a new key-value pair: `"Phred": 21` and print the updated dictionary.
        - Retrieve and print the age of "Velma".
        - Remove "Scooby" and his age from the dictionary and print the updated dictionary.
        - Print all the keys in the dictionary.
        - Print all the values in the dictionary.

#### Bonus: 
Make and print a `list` of the keys in the Scooby dictionary using the output of `.keys()`.
